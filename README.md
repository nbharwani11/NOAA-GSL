### Coding Challenge

Instructions:
Given the two sample namelist fortran files in this repo, please write a Python based tool that gives a user a command line interface that takes file paths as input and provides a report on the differences between the two files as output. For context, Fortran doesn't care about section/key order, so it's often difficult for users to track down differences in values that two researchers may have prepared independently.
