# NOAA-GSL

## Coding Challenge

Instructions:
Given the two sample namelist fortran files in this repo, please write a Python based tool that gives a user a command line interface that takes file paths as input and provides a report on the differences between the two files as output. For context, Fortran doesn't care about section/key order, so it's often difficult for users to track down differences in values that two researchers may have prepared independently. 


## Getting Started with `f90nml` (A Python module for Fortran namelists)

The latest documentation for `f90nml` can be found at https://f90nml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### **Installation**

```$ pip install f90nml```

### **Set Up**

Clone the repository

```$ git clone https://github.com/nbharwani11/NOAA-GSL.git```
